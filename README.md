Just a simple project to publish a working IPTV URL list because most m3u URLs out there were not maintained properly and frequently.
This can be a very frustrating experience for any newbie.

To solve this problem, this project has few ideas:

1. Implement a web URL checker for each URL inside the IPTV URL list.
2. Disable any URL with HTTP 404 error.
